<p id="text" style="fontSize: 15px; fontFamily:"Calibri"">
  To connect to the Internet, you'll need an Internet service provider (ISP) and some hardware: ISP. An ISP is a company that
            gives you access to the Internet. You sign up for an account with an ISP just as you do for telephone service or utilities.
            ISPs are usually phone companies (for a DSL or fiber optic connection) or TV providers (for a cable or satellite connection).
<br>
Hardware. For a broadband connection, such as DSL, fiber optic, or cable, you'll need a broadband modem. This might be included as
            part of the start-up hardware from yout ISP when you sign up for a broadband account. If you plan to share Internet access with
            multiple PCs by using a home network, you'll also need a router.
